			<u>We can say that optimization is the art of efficiency, 
			where the aim is to achieve the best possible outcome 
			with minimal resources and effort. In contrast, brute 
			force approaches rely on sheer computational power and 
			exhaustive trial-and-error to find a solution, often 
			disregarding elegance and intelligence. Optimization 
			involves strategic analysis, clever algorithms, and 
			thoughtful design to streamline processes and solve 
			complex problems swiftly. It seeks to uncover patterns, 
			exploit shortcuts, and make informed decisions that lead 
			to superior results. While brute force might guarantee a 
			solution, optimization empowers us to navigate the intricate 
			landscape of challenges, extracting the most value while 
			conserving time and resources.</u>
